# Statistics: Open slides
1. In this repo, we share the slides for the course "Math 362 -- Mathematical Statistics II"
   in the Department of Mathematics, Emory University, taught by me in 2021 Spring.
2. This second part of the sequence of probability and statistics course that covers
   the statistics part. The text book is:
   *  "An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics", by Richard J. Larsen and Morris L. Marx, 6th Ed.
   *  ![Textbook](./Texbook.png "An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics")
3. The course page can be found here:
